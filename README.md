## 🏗️ Gameplay Summary

- Place buildings (Barracks, Power Plants, etc.) on the grid.
- Select a barracks to spawn units using the buttons.
- Units can be commanded to move or attack using right-click.
- Each building has health, size, and production rules.
- Buildings show a **flag** (valid) or **cross** (invalid) spawn point.
- Units automatically pathfind and retry attacks if blocked.

## 🔧 Systems Used

- **Object Pooling** → `ObjectPoolManager`
- **Grid Occupancy** → `GridManager`
- **A\* Pathfinding** → `Pathfinder.cs`
- **Event-based Input** → `ClickInputRouter`
- **LineRenderer Selection** → `UnitSelectionHandler`
- **Factory Pattern** → `UnitFactoryMB`, `BuildingFactoryMB`
- **Data-Driven Setup** → ScriptableObjects for Units & Buildings
- **Sprite Atlas** → Packed via Unity’s Atlas system
- **Responsive Camera** → Dynamically resizes based on resolution & layout
- **UI Panels** → TMP-based with dynamic info population

---

## 💬 Notes

- Custom spawn point is placed using right-click on ground with a **building selected**.
- Selection line is shown using a `LineRenderer`, not a UI element → fully resolution-independent.
- UI scales with `CanvasScaler` and adapts to both portrait and landscape.
- Health bars and info panels are updated in real-time using `Events`.
